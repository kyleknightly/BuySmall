As microbes become defenseless and exposed to oxidation, water retains higher chlorination levels and will no longer calcify.  Microbes CANNOT Form Resistance to BiCARBUS Activated Sodium Hypochlorite	www.bicarbus.com	5301 POLK ST BLDG 14	29.734296	-95.319006

Geosapient, Inc.		GeoSapient is a post-concept, pre-revenue startup in the Geospatial Analytics-as-a-Service market targeting the Energy and Utilities domains. Massive change in the remote sensing industry is resulting in the democratization and commoditization of earth-orbiting products. Satellite data collection companies collect imagery daily to weekly and struggle with how to monetize their data with dwindling industry analysts. For companies in these domains, analysts and management are overwhelmed with data, find it hard to identify and analyze data volumes for timely, efficient decision making, while finding it costly to purchase, acquire, and archive data.	geosapient.com	14518 Terrace Bnd	29.9952328	-95.6341096

Dropless Dropaids, LLC		DROPLESS DROPAIDS HAS TAKEN THE SKILL OUT OF THE EYE DROP PROBLEM BY DEVISING THE FILTER MATRIX APPLICATOR (FMA) - THE FIRST AND ONLY APPLICATOR THAT CAN CAPTURE, STORE, AND RELEASE A PRECISE DOSE OF MEDICATION TO THE EYE SAFELY, CLEANLY, AND EASILY. Therefore, Dropless is able to: 1. STANDARDIZE eye drop instillation for everyone (regardless of age, sex, or manual/visual capabilities). 2.

HOW IT WORKS: - Eliminates the need to lift the head and aim the hands, - Eliminates the need to stare directly at the eye dropper bottle while reducing blinking, - Pocket-sized, featherweight, and ergonomic makes eye drop instillation completely intuitive and effortless, and - Dramatically reduces eye drop spillover to the cheek.		8990 Kirby Dr Ste 220	29.6738524	-95.4127331

Six Star Services II Inc.	Orchestra Macrosystems	Orchestra Macrosystems​ is a software company focused on multi-disciplinary capability assessment. Twenty-first century combat hinges on the speed at which a force can move to its next maneuver, and requires that decisions be made faster than in any previous warfighting style. Assessing readiness in a dynamic, multi-domain operations environment requires intelligent measurement tools that ingest and analyze a diverse array of data inputs simultaneously. To meet these requirements, Orchestra Macrosystems developed a proprietary scoring and record-keeping software suite, which FORSCOM piloted at Fort Bliss in September 2019 to administer the Army Combat Fitness Test across multiple battalions.	www.orchestramacro.com	4801 Woodway Dr Ste 140w	29.7635897	-95.4601709

Active Water Solutions, L.L.C.		Active Water Solutions specializes in the treatment of wastewater for decentralized and reuse applications. By focusing on low flow (≤500k gpd), AWS provides packaged, containerized, and mobile systems depending on your situation and needs. AWS manufactures prefabricated portable packaged wastewater treatment units that arrive ready to hook up to an influent source. The unit utilizes fixed-bed biofilm technology and is a more effective alternative to activated sludge (AS) suspended growth systems. AWS provides a wastewater treatment solution that’s simple and easy to operate. The core technology behind AWS is the submerged fixed-bed biofilm reactor (SFBBR). Biological wastewater treatment requires bacteria and other microorganisms to break down organic matter in the liquid. But, instead of the organisms floating randomly in the wastewater where they can be prone to “washouts” and other disruptions, the biofilm development area in the AWS system is fixed.	http://www.activewatersolutions.com	100 Waugh Dr. Ste 400	29.7657502	-95.3987614
