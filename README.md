This project was created as an entry in the Texas Performance Standards Project (TPSP) competition.

The goal was to enable Houstonians to find registered small businesses to support, and it was created using data from the Small Business Administration (SBA).

All code was written by me (Kyle Knightly) over the 2019-2020 academic year.
